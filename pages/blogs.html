                Reflection:
                Our team did really well in working together, creating individual separate work that was able to be merged into one coherent and well developed game. This is evidenced by the fairly polished final product and general lack of conflict during merges aside from initial issues stemming from a lack of practice with github. 
                If we had another 2 weeks to work on it, our top 3 priorities would be the following
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clean up the code to be more readable for both our future selves and anyone who views it.</li>
                <li>Implement more mechanics such as wall jumping to provide further depth to level design.</li>
                <li>Create more levels past the final stage with new types of bosses.</li>
            </ol>
