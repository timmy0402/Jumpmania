            <h2>Alpha</h2>
            <p>At this stage, many players had suggested that the enemies was too strong and too buggy. The shooting
                controls at this stage is used by arrow keys hence not intuitive. Also, there is no objectice yet on how
                to win and lose which meant more mechanics need to be added.</p>
            <h2>Beta</h2>
            <p>Players think that there should be more than 1 level. Also, the shop should have some visual instead of
                just plain text. Camera needs to be smaller so that player can be more focus in the game. In addition,
                movement need to be polish along with some game physics such as the bounce.</p>
            <h2>Final</h2>

            <h2 id="name">Team Reflection</h2>
            <p align="left">
                Reflection:
                Our team did really well in working together, creating individual separate work that was able to be
                merged into one coherent and well developed game. This is evidenced by the fairly polished final product
                and general lack of conflict during merges aside from initial issues stemming from a lack of practice
                with github.
                If we had another 2 weeks to work on it, our top 3 priorities would be the following
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clean up the code to be more readable for both our future selves and anyone who views it.</li>
                <li>Implement more mechanics such as wall jumping to provide further depth to level design.</li>
                <li>Create more levels past the final stage with new types of bosses.</li>
            </ol>
