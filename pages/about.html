        <h2 id="name">The Lore</h2>
        <p>In Jumpmania, you play as an ordinary adventurer who has wandered into the forests looking for as much gold
            as you can get your grubby hands on. Fight through hordes of enemies, or challenge yourself to avoid them
            entirely, as you parkour through a series of platforms and make your way to the final boss!
        </p>
        <h2 id="name">Game Design</h2>
        <p>Jumpmania is a platform game where you control the player, an adventurer wandering through a forest.</p>
        <p>Traverse the forest by jumping on platforms while fighting (or avoiding) enemies</p>
        <p>Buy upgrades from the shop, collect coins and hearts, and make your way to the goal. Watch out for the big
            boss at the end!</p>
        <p>The game only work on the Web(you should be able to play at this point!!)</p>
        <p>Rated "E" for everyone</p>
        <h2 id="name">The Idea</h2>
        <p>This game is part of a final project for the CSS385 Intro to Game Development class of Spring 2024. We(the
            dev) are all new to game developement and we wanted to make a 2D platformer that simple enough for beginner
            but also challenging for learning purpose.
        </p>
        <p>We based our project on some of more established game below but with key similarites and differences:</p>

        <h3>Cuphead</h3>

        <p>Simularities: Platforming and shooting things</p>
        <p>Differences: No bosses, you are not a cup.</p>

        <h3> Mario</h3>

        <p>Simularities: Platforming towards a finish line with items and enemies</p>
        <p>Differences: You are (probably) not a plumber.</p>

        <h3>Kirby</h3>

        <p>Similarities: Platformer with finish line and enemies and items.</p>
        <p>Differences: Can't fly (maybe) and not a rotund widdle pink alien.</p>

        </ul>
